# NQT_Coding_Questions

### Thses are TCS_NQT previous year coding questions

## List Of All Questions

## 1.Checking if a given year is leap year or not

##  2.Find the 15th term of the series?

### 0,0,7,6,14,12,21,18, 28

### Explanation : In this series the odd term is increment of 7 {0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 – – – – – – }

### And even term is a increment of 6 {0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 – – – – – – } 
              
## 3.Consider the following series:

###  1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27, 16, 81, 32, 243, 64, 729, 128, 2187 …

### This series is a mixture of 2 series – all the odd terms in this series form a geometric series and all the even terms form yet another geometric series. Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.



## 4.Consider the below series : Write a program to find the nth term in this series.

### 0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8

### This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous  term using the formula (x/2)

## 5. The program will recieve 3 English words inputs from STDIN

### a.These three words will be read one at a time, in three separate line
### b.The first word should be changed like all vowels should be replaced by %
### c.The second word should be changed like all consonants should be replaced by #
### d.The third word should be changed like all char should be converted to upper case
### e.Then concatenate the three words and print them

### --For example if you print how are you then output should be h%wa#eYOU.

## Addition of two numbers a Twist

### 1. Using a method, pass two variables and find the sum of two numbers.

### Test case:

### Number 1 – 20

### Number 2 – 20.38

### Sum = 40.38

### There were a total of 4 test cases. Once you compile 3 of them will be shown to you and 1 will be a hidden one. You have to display error message if numbers are not numeric.
